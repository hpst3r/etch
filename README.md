## Features:

* Gutted fork of Etch with features tailored specifically for my use, refactored for readability and ease of use
* Credit for everything that isn't broken goes to the original author [Lukas Joswiak](github.com/LukasJoswiak)

## Installation

Add the theme:
```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/hpst3r/etch.git themes/etch
```
and add it to hugo.toml or build the site with `-t etch`

Then, use the theme to generate your site.

Hi, future me. Use:
```
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```
to grab the submodule for a new environment.
